# Netfilx-Clone
This project is a simple Netflix UI clone built with Vuejs. This project serve as a project for me to practice using Vuejs and API composition. 

# Additional Package Used
- Axios for API calls
- Tailwindcss

# API Key
I got my API key from [The Movie Database Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/). You just have to register an account on it, check your email to verify your account, then go to the API page in your profile settings and your API key will be there.

# Remarks
Feel free to use any part of the code, and also I would be happy if you can provide me any suggestion to improve this project.
